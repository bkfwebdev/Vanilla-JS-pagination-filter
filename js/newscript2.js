// there are two types of pages regular pages and search pages
// search pages are throw away pages, they can be deleted whenm a new search is performed
// or when the page is reset
// regular pages are somewhat permanent
// creat pages logic
// go through all student
// add student to page until 10 students have been added
// if there are more students left add another page and repeat
// until all students have been paginated
